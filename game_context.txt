GAME CONTEXT

Essentially this is another page of more notes loool

game story
assets
hero big dude
learn sprite animation
hero will animate in running and jumping and idle.
enemy animates but the hero must avoid them
hero picks up an item currently is a coin
animate that item above platform
picking up the item which is currently a coin will increase the score of the player
the goal of the game is to reach the end goal.
terrain is not auto generated
map is preset
make some plat forms differ in size properties and functions
game background
add sound and music
bachround music starts as soon as game loads loops if the music file is finished and stops playing when the program is closed
the player has a jump sound
collecting the item gives a sound
touching the enemy and dying makes a death sound.
the player restarts the whole level when he dies by touching the enemy or terrain fail.
score is not reset because it just indicates how much of that item he has received.
the ui will show the number of tries attempted in beating the level
the game title not decided yet
and the collection score
after game is done
the game resets automatically to the beginning.
if the player reaches the end goal the game ends and tells the player that they beat the game level.
there should be a restart game button and a exit game button then.
for the start menu
game background
title
game start
and exit game
i have decided at the begining of the game level where the player is first spawned.
it will show the controls and basics of the game as text within the game screen map
when this project is done submit via ecentennial and the github repository.
